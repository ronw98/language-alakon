# langage-alakon
The idea is to learn how to create an programming laguage, in a crazy way.
Really basic stuff (ints and bools) is now operationnal.

## Developpement
### Installation
This project requires flex and bison in order to work.
To install them on Ubuntu, open a terminal and type:
```bash
sudo apt install flex bison
```
You will also need gcc (which should be already installed on your computer).

### Running the programm
To build the compiler , just execute the make script:
```bash
./make
```
To compile an alakon program:
```bash
alk testProgram.kon
```
(.kon is the extension for alakon programs)

## Non-dev
### Compiling a programm
To compile an alakon program:
```bash
alk testProgram.kon
```
(.kon is the extension for alakon programs)

## What is coming next
Syntax shortcuts (+=, -= ...), comparators and constrol structs / loops. Oh and mybe and negative numbers as well. Could be usefull.
